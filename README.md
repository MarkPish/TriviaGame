Javascript Assignment 2
The Italian Trivia Game

The rules of the game are as follows:
You have 2 minutes to answer 12 questions relating to Italy. 
The questions range from geographical, economical and historical references.
Questions will appear one at a time, allowing only one answer per question.
Once you answer, click on the 'next' button.
The game will end with you completing the quiz, at which point your number correct will be shown from the 12 questions, or if the timer runs out before you finish the quiz.
Select the 'start again' button to retake the quiz.

The languages used in this game were jQuery, Javascript, Html and Css.

I really enjoyed working on this game since my grandfather was born in Italy and being Italian has been an important part of my life.
